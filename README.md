## Dataset Overview

The "Cardiotography" dataset is a collection of medical data aimed at classifying patients into one of three categories: 'Normal', 'Suspected to have disease', or 'Actual disease'. This dataset contains various features that can be used for classification tasks.                

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.7+ recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-forest-cardiotography.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd random-forest-cardiotography
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Explore the dataset by running `Cardiotography_EDA.ipynb`. This Jupyter Notebook provides insights into the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships between features.

### Random Forest Model

- Train and evaluate a Random Forest classifier on the dataset by running `Cardiotography_RandomForest.ipynb`. This notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Evaluation and Results

- Examine the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
- Visualize the results using Matplotlib or other relevant visualization libraries.
